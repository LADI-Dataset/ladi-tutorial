## Getting Started
[Getting Started](https://github.com/NaeRong/DS440_Capstone/blob/master/Tutorials/Getting%20Started.md) 

This documentation is about installing AWS tools and configuring AWS environment to download LADI dataset and load dataset in Python locally and remotely.

## Clean and Validate LADI Dataset
[Clean and Validate LADI Dataset](https://github.com/NaeRong/DS440_Capstone/blob/master/Tutorials/Clean%20and%20Validate%20LADI%20Dataset.md)
This documentation is about clean the LADI dataset. For this project, we have only extracted 2000 images for training.

## PyTorch Data Loading
[PyTorch Data Loading](https://github.com/NaeRong/DS440_Capstone/blob/master/Tutorials/Pytorch%20Data%20Load.md) 

This documentation is about loading LADI dataset in PyTorch framework including examples of writing custom `Dataset`, `Transforms` and `Dataloader`.

## Train and Test A Classifier
[Train and Test A Classifier](https://github.com/NaeRong/DS440_Capstone/blob/master/Tutorials/Train%20and%20Test%20A%20Classifier.md)

This documentation is about training and testing a classifier model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch.

## Fine Tuning Torchvision Models
[Fine Tuning Torchvision Models](Tutorials/Fine%20Tuning%20Torchvision%20Models.md)

This documentation is about training and testing a classifier model using pre-trained ResNet and AlexNet.

## SageMaker Build Train and Deploy ML Models
[SageMaker Build Train and Deploy ML Models](Tutorials/SageMaker%20-%20Build,%20Train,%20and%20Deploy%20ML%20Model.md)

This documentation is about migrating model scripts into the AWS SageMaker environment.
